He steps in front of you, Arranis.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<changeFont Brynn inCharacter>>Very well, Shadowfall. Let’s bring an end to this dance of ours! But first, just so your comrades don’t intervene...\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<fadeOutSound CuedMusicStings>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>He touches his amulet again, and more crystals rise out of the ground in a dome shape around you and him.\r\nIt covers the floor beneath you, as well, isolating both you and him from your allies and the effects of any electrical current.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<overridePose Lance happy>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX lancePositive>>Alright, let’s do this!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Everyone else, you see the magical storm above start to glow and crackle.\r\n<<triggerSound CuedMusicStings musicTrackTwo>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<changeFont Brynn inCharacter>>You can’t defeat me, Shadowfall, and you certainly can’t defeat me before my storm wipes out your friends!\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX allisonSeriously>>Goddammit, Lance...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Alright, I brandish Starcleaver.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Narravar scowls upon seeing an enchanted blade.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<changeFont Brynn inCharacter>>You think some glowing sword will be enough to do me in?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>><<overridePose Lance irritated>>It was enough for my father when he used it to defeat you all those years ago, and it will be enough for me to finish you off now!\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<overridePose Lance neutral>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Alright, roll initiative!\r\n<<rollD20 Brynn>>\r\n<<rollD20 Lance>>\r\n<<rollD20 Allison>>\r\n<<rollD20 Ruby>>\r\n<<rollD20 Franklin>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Okay, the storm goes first. A bolt of lightning strikes the metal floor and does 20 points of damage to everyone outside the crystal dome.\r\nThat goes double if you’re wearing metal armor.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Oof, okay.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Allison, you’re up. What do you do?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>I call out to Franklin and Ruby.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>><<overridePose Lance neutral>>Vel, Gundren! Attack the dome. We need to kill Narravar to end the storm spell, now!\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Do you each do so?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Yes! I hurl Eldritch Blasts at it.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>And I hit it with my axe.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>The crystal dome looks damaged, but it will take a lot more than that to bring it down.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>Relax, I have this under control!\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<overridePose Lance happy>>I grin at Narravar, so that he sees how confident I am...\r\n<<rollD20 Lance>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>...then slash him with Starcleaver.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Looks good. Narravar screams out in pain as the blade strikes home. Because he’s a dark magic user, he takes a ton of extra damage. In fact, he’s already bloodied.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>On his turn, Narravar follows up with a powerful Eldritch Blast.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I use Uncanny Dodge.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Nice! In that case, you only take 10 damage. Speaking of which, the rest of you take another 20 or 40 as another lightning strike hits the floor outside the dome.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I try to attack the dome again, I suppose.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>You do so. It’s a little more damaged than it was before, but not by much.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>><<overridePose Allison irritated>>Why bother, Vel? Arannis has this <i>under control.</i>\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I take another slash at Narravar!\r\n<<rollD20 Lance>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Oooh, with that he’s down! How do you want to do this?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I twirl the sword around in my hand...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>This one’s for you, father.\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>... and then I stab him in the chest.\r\n<<fadeOutSound CuedMusicStings>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Alright, Narravar is dead. \r\nThe storm ends, and the columns of crystal blocking the exits disintegrate, meaning you’re all free to go. The crystal dome disintegrates as well.\r\n<<overridePose Franklin neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Ruby neutral>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<overridePose Allison irritated>>I grab Arannis by the collar.\r\n<<triggerSound CuedMusicStings musicTrackFour>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>Don’t you <i>ever</i> do that again.\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<overridePose Lance irritated>>Okay, I squirm out of your grip.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>I’m not apologizing for killing that monster.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>Then apologize for almost killing <i>us!</i>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>><<someoneInterrupting Lance AllisonDoYouEvenCare 2 interruptionOne>>Okay then. Excuse me for slaying the one person I’ve spent years of my life hunting. Sorry, my mistake—\r\n\r\n[[Rebranch7]]",

As if to answer, the storm lets out a massive thunderclap that reverberates throughout the room...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<overridePose Brynn happy>>...causing the suspended chandelier in the room to shake as well, making a jingling sound.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Wait, what’s holding up the chandelier?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>It looks like silver chains.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<overridePose Allison happy>>Oh, man, <i>perfect!</i>\r\n<<triggerSound CuedMusicStings musicTrackTwo>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<overridePose Allison neutral>>Okay, okay, I telepathically reach out to Franklin and Ruby.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>Gundren, can you hurl a weapon at one of those chandelier chains?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>><<changeFont Franklin inCharacter>>I think so.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>Vel, once he does that, could you use your Telekinesis spell to wrap one end of that chain around Narravar?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>I can certainly try.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>Alright, Gundren. Fire at will.\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>Okay, I hurl one of my handaxes past the storm and at one of the chandelier chains.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<overridePose Brynn neutral>>Okay, give me an attack roll.\r\n<<rollD20 Franklin>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>18.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>That does it, but Narravar saw that happen. He says a few arcane words, and the storm starts to crackle with lightning.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I cast Telekinesis, and use it to grab the free end of the chain and wrap it around Narravar’s ankle.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>You have advantage, given that he still doesn’t suspect what you’re up to, but I’ll still need you to roll for it to see if you succeed.\r\n<<rollD20 Ruby>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Uh, 7, and... \r\n<<rollD20 Ruby>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<overridePose Ruby happy>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX rubyPositive>>...17!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Okay, Narravar has chains around his ankle and... \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>...He’s getting electrocuted by his own storm!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Okay, while he’s stunned, I draw my sword and run him through.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>><<overridePose Ruby neutral>>Arannis, wait! Your sword is made of metal, you’ll be electrocuted too!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>I swore at my father’s grave that I would use his blade to slay Narravar!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>It’s too dangerous! Arannis, please!\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<overridePose Lance irritated>>I... I stand down, I guess.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Okay, Narravar is so overwhelmed by the electrical shock that he can’t react or get free. It’s only a matter of time before he collapses.\r\n<<fadeOutSound CuedMusicStings>>\r\n<<overridePose Franklin neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Ruby neutral>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>The storm ends, and the columns of crystal blocking the exits disintegrate, meaning you’re all free to go.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>><<overridePose Allison happy>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX allisonPositive>>Excellent work, everyone! That all went off without a hitch.\r\n<<changeFont Brynn outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I run over to Narravar. Is he dead?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Well, yes. You can’t feel a heartbeat, so you can only assume that he’s deceased.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>><i>And</i> we did it all without taking so much as an ounce of damage.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>><<overridePose Lance irritated>>Are you kidding me?
