She can also put it on and take it off it just by casting a spell, right?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Exactly. She doesn’t wear it when she’s out of combat, but she can cast a spell to summon it instantaneously.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>Everyone, she can summon her armor at a moment’s notice. She’s vulnerable now, but won’t be for long. Now would be the best time to attack, except...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>... The general.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>Right.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>Tiana, we can use your plan from last time.

We need every advantage we can get to bring Malacatha down. \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>If we make the first attack now while she’s vulnerable, we’ll have a much better chance of beating her and ending this...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<changeFont Allison inCharacter>>… But if we give her a chance to use her greatest weapon from the start, she could wipe us out.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>><<overridePose Lance irritated>>...

We’d need to get a ton of health back, and you’d be losing a lot of valuable spell slots.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>Could we at least try?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>Guys, come on, Lady Malacatha’s right there!

So now what?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Well, Ruby and I were talking earlier. \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Would you all be interested in starting a new campaign? I've got plenty of ideas for where it could go.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>Yeah, I'd be down.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I'm in, of course!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>So... you two?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<cueSimultaneousDialogue Allison LanceAwkwardSilenceTwo null null>>...\r\n\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX lanceThinking>>So, uh, Allison, do you think we could talk outside for a sec?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Yeah, sure.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>We'll be right back.\r\n<<showCharacter Allison false>>\r\n<<showCharacter Lance false>>\r\n<<triggerSound EnvironmentSoundFX sitDown>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>Guess they’re gonna talk it out, finally. What happens if they say no? It wouldn't be much of a campaign with only two players.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>I mean, unless one of them stays and the other leaves, I guess.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>That would be kind of awkward.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Yeah, I don't know. But, listen... Brynn, whatever happens, thanks for helping keeping things under control today.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>I don't know, I'm not sure I'd call today, \"under control\", exactly.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>It could've been a lot worse. Trust me.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Yeah. You're a good friend, Brynn.\r\n<<overridePose Franklin happy>>\r\n<<overridePose Ruby happy>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>... And a pretty good Dungeon Master.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>><<overridePose Brynn happy>>Thanks, Ruby.\r\n<<overridePose Lance neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Ruby neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Franklin neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Allison neutral>>\r\n<<overridePose Brynn neutral>>\r\n<<showCharacter Allison true>>\r\n<<showCharacter Lance true>>\r\n<<triggerSound EnvironmentSoundFX sitDown>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Okay, so, we talked it over and—\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<overridePose Lance happy>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX lanceYeahNice>>We're in, baby!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Yeah, I mean, we're still working out some stuff, but...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>><<overridePose Allison happy>>... But this is really fun, so, yeah. We're in. When do we start?\r\n<<overridePose Lance happy>>\r\n<<overridePose Ruby happy>>\r\n<<overridePose Franklin happy>>\r\n<<overridePose Allison happy>>\r\n<<overridePose Brynn happy>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<triggerSound VocalBarkSoundFX rubyYes>>Yes!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Alright! Well, it'll be a little while before I get all the details of the campaign sorted out, but we can roll for characters in the meantime.\r\n<<fadeSound CuedMusicStings>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Ooh, definitely! So, I've been getting a ton of ideas for Vel's twin sister that I wanted to run by you guys…\r\n<<sendToWinScreen Brynn>>",
