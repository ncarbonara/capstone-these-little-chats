You make your way around to the front of the castle. Malacatha’s army is there, as you saw previously. There are skeletons emerging from the castle, in a long, clattering column, alongside various undead.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Alright, folks, I cast Seeming on everyone, making us all look like... let’s say zombies. Then we move inside.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Oh, and we should shamble. Like zombies.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Sounds good. There’s space for you to enter on either side of the column, and the undead aren’t intelligent enough to perceive you entering.
