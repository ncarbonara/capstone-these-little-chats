I vault off a piece of rubble near the castle, flip gloriously in the air, then leap between any outcroppings on the wall until I reach the top.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I then roll on top of the wall, look around to make sure I’m undetected, then stand up and straighten the collar of my shirt.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>After that, I find somewhere to tie something and let down a rope for everyone to follow.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>One of the spaces between the crenellations will work for that.
