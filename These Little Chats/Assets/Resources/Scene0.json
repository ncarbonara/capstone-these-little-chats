They’d met many friends along the way, some of them brave warriors, some of them ordinary townsfolk…\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Never forget Larry the bagel shop owner, whose shop we destroyed.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>…Yes, even a merchant selling bagels, despite the fact that bagels didn’t exist in medieval times. Truly, he will never stop being angry about his shop burning down.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I’m still really sorry about that!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>And now, inspired by the heroes, these friends and comrades have begun an assault on Lady Malacatha’s citadel.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>If all goes well, the group will finally complete the mission they’ve had for so long.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Okay, so where exactly are we again? We’re near Lady Malacatha’s citadel now, right?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Right. You guys are a little ways off to the east of Malacatha’s castle. Currently you’re hiding behind some of the pointed rocks which litter the jagged terrain surrounding it. \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Peeking out from your hiding spots, you’re able to see the castle straight ahead of you in all its glooming, gothic majesty. \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>To the south, in front of the castle’s main gates, you can see the armies of the Fullcrest alliance that you helped create charging toward a huge gathering of undead monsters guarding the castle.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>The sooner we reach Malacatha and stop her the better their chances will be. We’ve gotta start moving.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Exactly what I was going to say. \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>><<changeFont Lance inCharacter>>Vel, would you be a dear and start the teleportation spell for us? <<changeFont Lance outOfCharacter>>\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>…?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Oh, Vel! That’s me, right! Sorry, it has been a while since I’ve played her, you know? Uh, *ahem*...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>><<changeFont Ruby inCharacter>>Why of course, Arannis!<<changeFont Ruby outOfCharacter>> \r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Where should I teleport us? Straight for the throne room?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Preferably right on top of Malacatha’s stupid face, if you would.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I cast mass teleport!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Okay, okay, so as you begin casting mass teleport, I’m going to need you to make a Wisdom check.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>A Wisdom check? That’s...new. Okay um…\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>18.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>18? Sorry but as you begin casting mass teleport you begin to feel the influence of something emanating from the direction of the castle, filling your mind with overwhelming pain.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>Uh… so what happens?\r\n[[You recognize Malacatha's influence.|YouRecognizeTheInfluence]]\r\n[[You take damage!|YouTakeDamage]]\r\n",

Oh my God!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Harsh, Brynn.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Brynn>>Just wanted to raise the stakes a little.

		"body": "<<activateSpeechBubble Franklin>>Yikes. Well, that sucks for us.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Yeah no kidding. Any chance you could try again?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>I don’t know, I don’t think it’d work. I got an 18 on that check and I still failed it, the DC must be really high.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Looks like we’ve gotta get in the old fashioned way then. Just leave it all to me guys. Arranis has got this.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Oh, here we go…\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>What, Allison?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Just you doing your whole solo-act thing. That’s what.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>We’re supposed to be a team. This is a team, right everybody? Or was that just my impression?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Uh, okay, chill for a second. Listen to this, it’s really simple.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I scale the wall with my ninja skills, quickly and quietly take out anyone who might be on top of the wall, and once the coast is clear I tie a rope to the top and toss it down so you guys can climb up.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>I’m telling ya, it’s foolproof!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Okay, yeah, sure. Definitely no way anyone on the wall notices that all happening.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>So here’s my plan.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Oh, brother...\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>Instead of that, we just tunnel under the wall with Vel’s magic.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>I’ll make fog so that we don’t get seen approaching the wall. Once we’re next to it, Vel will tunnel us underneath until we reach the closest part of the castle.\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>From the plans we saw, the nearest room of the castle should only be about 50 feet from the edge of the wall. We tunnel under it, then we all burst up into it and take out anyone in it before they have a chance to alert anyone!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Ruby>>That sounds like it could really work!\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Lance>>Yeah but it’s way more complicated then just getting onto the wall. Besides, we have no idea what or who is in that room but you want to just rush into it?\r\n<<activateSpeechBubble Allison>>As a team? Yup, I do. Besides, can’t be much riskier than leaving the fate of this mission entirely up to you. If you get seen once it’s all over now. We don’t have teleportation as an option anymore.\r\n",
