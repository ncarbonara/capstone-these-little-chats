I knew going away for college would make seeing them more difficult but I didn’t think I’d have to wait until the end of the semester to come back…\r\n->Gotta say, it's good we're all together again.\r\n->I hope this isn't too awkward.\r\nGrabbing a large tray from under the sink, I start placing as much of the food onto it as I can.\r\nWell, at least it seems that nothing terrible has happened since I’ve left. Probably because college has been keeping them as busy as its been keeping me.\r\nEveryone except Lance anyway, since he opted not to go so he could focus on making music. I wonder if he and Allison are still trying to start that band together?\r\n->Their sound was pretty good.\r\n->I wonder if they've been able to stay in touch about it\r\nI know it’s been a bit of a pipe dream of theirs for a while, but maybe after all this time they’ve finally started putting that plan into motion?\r\nIf there was ever anyone who was going to try starting a band while they were already going to college AND traveling the world, Allison’s probably the only person crazy enough to try it.\r\nShe’s always been pretty confident about her multi-tasking superpower, but even that kind of workload might be a bit much for her.\r\n->Aah, she can probably handle it.\r\n->I hope she isn't pushing herself too hard.\r\nOh God, and speaking of workloads I can’t believe Franklin has ANOTHER job. How many is he juggling now? I’ll never know how he finds time to do any of his coursework, or sleep for that matter.\r\nWhat does Ruby think about it? I mean, maybe they’ve been dating for so long that she’s used to it by now?\r\nAlthough I’m sure she’s been busy as well, learning how to be a forensic scientist and all. It’s been a dream of hers since I’ve known her, I wonder how she’s officially working towards it?\r\n->I wonder how those classes are going.\r\n->I wonder if she decided to stick with that program.\r\nLifting up the stacked tray, I carefully started heading back to the table I’d sat my friends at. No point thinking about these questions all by myself when I could ask them, right?\r\n",
